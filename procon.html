<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 60px; color: #7A378B; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">Introduction <br></b></p>
<p class="text" style="position: relative; top: -40px;">
  GM crops have several different purposes, ranging from resistance to pests to adapting in environmental conditions. However, such a product is bound to have several pros and cons regarding its economic, environmental and human attributes. Take a look at the different pros and cons of Genetically Modified Organisms.

<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #00CC66; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">Tolerance</b></p>
To begin, one of the most prominent benefits refers to the resistance to insects and tolerance to herbicides. As a result of this, the need to use pesticide applications diminishes, and so there is a reduction in the level of mycotoxins (toxic compounds) in the crops. Farmers can also reduce the exposure to chemicals and lower pesticide residues in food and feed crops while also releasing fewer chemicals into the environment. This is valuable as it could potentially increase the on-farm diversity in insects and pollinators, which in the end, results in healthier crops that can sustain the given population. To continue, GM crops commonly are unaffected by excessive heat, cold or drought. This is crucial for crops as it follows with the benefit of increased crops for farmers and higher quality food for the retailer and consumer.  
<br><br>
</p>  
<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #00CC66; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">Economy</b></p>GM crops are essential in an economic aspect. As one first enters their local grocery stores and strolls through the fruits and vegetable section, the first thing that catches their eye is for the brightest of them all. This is a comprehensive business strategy, in which the producer takes the product and envisions it from the consumer’s point of view. This technique to gain more customers directly focuses on the next benefit of GM crops, which may include more durable colours, an increase in shelf life and the elimination of seeds. As explained earlier, more durable colours attract more attention, shelf-life benefits the company’s stock and fruits without seeds often provide more reason for a consumer to buy a product. GM crops are sold into the market and subjected to market in terms of providing value propositions for producers and through the food chain in regards to reduced costs of production. As a result of a lower production cost and a higher yield for GMOs, farmers will increase in economic return to produce food at affordable prices.  
<br><br>
</p>  
<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #00CC66; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">Health</b></p> There are many assumptions that GM crops are indefinitely bad for one’s health; however, there is a positive impact. These plants can help reduce the chance of disease, insecticides and other herbicides. There is still a lack of studies, and so there is a potential human health impact of the consumption of food or feed. Most of the public work has been subject to skepticism and criticism, which describes how there is no confirmation but still the possibility of positive influence. Certain foods can also be with specific proteins, carbohydrates, essential amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins minerals, and more, which can help solve malnutrition and provide more energy concentration in ecosystems. For example, Golden rice is a bio-fortified GM crop that helps against Vitamin A deficiency for 250 - 500k children annually and is very common in parts of Africa and Asia. 
<br><br>
</p>
<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #00CC66; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">Environment</b></p> There are also several environmental benefits to GM crops with regards to greenhouse gases, food supply, prevention of disease and increasing ecosystem biodiversity. According to the New York Times, GM crops which are tolerant to herbicides, can promote an easier way to manage weeds. As there is a reduction in management, tractor emissions would reduce. Studies show that in 2015, this led to a mass reduction in emissions, equivalent to a reduction of approximately 12 million cars. Further, one very large impact would be regarding the food and its insects. As explained earlier, GM crops are great for resistance to insects which is a great benefit for farms and exponential crop growth. To continue, TEDx explains a study at a papaya farm that was near extinction. And so, the government made a decision to incorporate GM crops to create a resistance to viruses. As seen by their successes, GM crops were highly useful in scenarios that would have major environmental and economic impacts. Finally, these crops allow for the biodiversity in several populations. Not long ago, in 2015, there were almost 50 million acres that were able to meet the wanted demand of specific crops due to GM crops! And so, these are visibly effective at preserving habitats and nature. 
<br><br>
</p>
  <p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #CC3333; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">Health</b></p> As GM crops have been increasingly introduced in several European countries, several health risks have been put in place, which has sparked a high interest in its negative capabilities. The three main issues regarding concerns for human health which are allergenicity, gene transfer and outcrossing. To begin, allergenicity is a very large issue that must be addressed. The transfer of genes from commonly allergenic organisms to non-allergic organisms is discouraged unless the protein product of the transferred gene is not allergenic. However, there are no specific proven allergenic effects to have been found in GM products currently on the market. To continue, transfer from Gm food to cells of the body or to bacteria in the GM tract would cause concern if transferred genetic material adversely affects human health. However, the probability of transfer is lower. Finally, migration of genes from Gm plants into conventional crops may have an indirect effect on food safety and security. Cases have been reported where Gm crops approved for animal feed or industrial use have been detected to have low levels in products intended for human consumption. Different strategies are implemented globally to reduce mixing including clear separation of fields within which GM crops and conventional crops are grown. GM crops also increase herbicide use and in the US, it has grown by more than 190%. There are also proven cancer and antibiotic-resistant side effects. 
<br><br>
</p>
<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #CC3333; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">Environment</b></p> There are also negative effects of GM crops on the environment with regards to an increased use of toxic herbicides, unforeseen consequences and contamination. Firstly, the vast majority of GMOs, as explained earlier, have traits of resistance to herbicides. However, this attribute creates chemical residue which has a calamitous result on nearby habitats and ecosystems; this may also strengthen the growth of superweeds. The assumption that GM crops reduce carbon levels is highly disputed, and experts explain how there is terrible damage done to the habitats around the crop feed. This, in the end, has been shown to kill off beneficial insects, leaves residue in the soil and reduces the fresh water. In essence, this is a huge negative impact on an entire ecosystem. Further, the process of making GM crops is quite complex, and so complications are bound to happen. By removing or adding an element, it becomes a very complicated and intense possess. And so, it is impossible to predict an exact outcome after a genetic modification. One example of this was in 1996, in which there was a 27% increase in major allergen, trypsin-inhibitor. Finally, contamination is a major negative environmental impact. Farmers are not required to separate their GM and conventional crops, and so there is a major effect on all products.
