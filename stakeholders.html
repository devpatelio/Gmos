  Geneous is dedicated to bringing clarity on the benefits and climate of the political and public debate of GM crop advantages and disadvantages. Over the course of the past 2 decades, there have been thousands of published pages of research papers and different conclusions on the benefits of GM crops, all of that which makes the situation and clarity of the issue more convoluted than ever. Moreso, the climate of information being spread across the public is often not an accurate display of the facts but rather speculation and unconfirmed statements. It is an interconnected stream of different stakeholders and factors all playing a synchronized symphony that fundamentally influence the perception and use of GMos. 

  <p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 60px; color: lightblue; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">The Factual Benefits <br></b></p>

GMOs have been proven to be cost-effective and significantly beneficial to farmers and consumers on average. Most GM crops are modified to combat the biggest inefficiencies in the agriculture industry including the ability to combat disease, viruses, and other pathogens through viral carriers by coding proteins that produce toxins that kill insects and pests. This ultimately reduces pesticide use and expenses for mass production and can lead to healthier, cleaner plants. This trait is labelled as insect resistance. Herbicide tolerance is also a common trait used specifically for glyphosate based herbicides to reduce the impact of herbicides on plants and kill off weeds. It is achieved through the introduction of a gene from a bacterium conveying resistance to certain herbicides. The most common crops in the commercial market are known as Bt Crops which are named for the gene in the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis which produce a crystal protein that improves the resistance of plants against insects. Virus and parasite resistance is achieved through the introduction of a certain gene from certain viruses which cause disease in plants, making plants less susceptible to diseases caused by such viruses. This recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the addition of other traits that are tailored to certain geographic features including drought resistance, better nutrient absorption, drought tolerance, and more. Plants including maize, corn, canola, soy, and cotton are more commonly found as genetically modified and make up 99% of the current GM crop market and land. These traits are often desirable as they are cost effective and have been able to boost global food output and consumption from developed to developing nations. The global economy fundamentally depends on GM crops in order to keep up with global demand, enabling other countries with poor climate conditions to grow their own sustainable food supply. The same technology has even helped create new biotechnological solutions such as GM insulins and new vaccines. To the consumer, they are able to reduce the cost of food. However, the idea of GM crops is not widely adopted. Only 30 countries produce GM crops and only five countries (United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, India) make up 90% of GM production. Studies from Oxford University’s Department of Agricultural Sciences found that GM crops have improved global productivity significantly across different countries that do not have access to advanced systems for weed maintenance and irrigation. It is also promised that GMOs can play an important role to close the world hunger gap in poorer regions of the world. These benefits have been proven through countless studies and tests but also are variable in terms of the impact they have globally. GM crops are often not entirely desirable by many because of the values of governments and consumers which indirectly have an impact on the agricultural industry. At the end of the day, the 3 key players in the GM crop project are the consumer, farmers and corporations, and governments. 
<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: lightblue; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">The Farmers, A Part Of The Puzzle</b></p>
The benefits GM crops offer to farmers are clear and resemble that of global interest. With greater consumption and productivity comes greater gross profits, seed ownership and independence, and simplistic procedures along with the reduced time and effort it takes to grow a plant. These crops enable farmers to earn more through the reduced costs for maintenance and increased consumption which is especially critical in poorer regions of the world whose economies fundamentally rely on the productivity of its agriculture sector to feed its large populations. However, this is where the grey area comes. The National Institute of Science compiled several sources and found several studies who concluded that the theoretical potential yield was far higher for GM crops than the actual yield. Farmers in these studies were shown to be entirely dependent on the yield as even small decreases in the yield could harm their potential profits. Another study reported a 20 percent increase in biomass yield of eucalyptus trees in Brazil (2015) which correlated with their improved pulp and paper industry. A study from 2005-2008 found that GM crops could increase yields in Europe by 7-12% for maize. The same study also found that profits for farmers increased by 69% for early adopters of GM crops due to the increased yields (21.5%) and decreased costs (39%). Despite GM plants being more expensive for farmers to adopt, their gross margins would still increase due to the decreased costs and improved yields. However, other studies in South Asia and parts of Europe found that there was no inherent difference in cost and return. In developing countries, studies varied significantly than in developed nations. In the Philippines, South Africa, Spain, and the Czech Republic, it was found that Bt maize yielded 0.55 tonnes/hectare more than maize without Bt. The adoption of GM crops for farmers is heavily dependent on the chemical industry as well. Herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops are well received by farmers since they can use herbicides to quickly kill weeds. Ever since the introduction of HT crops, the herbicide market has grown by more than 319% and is steadily growing. This incentivizes a relationship between herbicide companies and the GM crop industry. It does however put farmers under the influence of these major corporations as found to be one of the reasons why the EU is against GM crops.  Even with government opinions, the key factor that influences a farmer’s decision to adopt GM crops is fundamentally the consumer and their values which can be in many cases more scattered geographically based on ideation rather than rationality. 
<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: lightblue; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">The Consumer: Governance over GMOs</b></p>
The public concern around GMOs is justified in the light of natural and organic foods consuming the palettes of many people across the world. These concerns mainly revolve around 3 areas: human health, environmental safety, and trade impacts. GMOs offer many benefits to consumers such as providing more food to hungrier nations, provide more choices to consumers, offer lower prices for greater return, and allow for seed ownership. On the other hand, GMOs are said to lead to overproducing food which can lead to “excess distribution, access, and waste” as mentioned in a report outlined by the European Union. While GM seed and crops are found to raise productivity, other studies show that GM crops have found no significant difference between the yield promised from GM seeds and their current yield. Consumers are often not found to be educated on the real effects of the plants and while reports are mixed, almost all show signs of improvement in not just the yield but the agriculture business model as a whole. There is global pressure on GMOs as a result of marketing and the presence of organics in modern day markets. GM crops are hence not well approached by farmers because consumers can choose not to buy their products. Ultimately, it is a liability rather than an asset in the world of business. A study conducted by the Hartman Group found that in 2019, 97% of consumers knew what GMOs were and half avoided buying products with GMOs. A quarter did not know enough about GMOs and a third withheld their support of companies that use GMOs in their formulations. This is safe to say as the NON-GMO industry has grown from $344.8 million in 2010 to $26.5 billion as of today. MOre than 70% of those who stated that they chose not to purchase GM products had a primary concern of health issues while 30% had concern for the environment and wanted food transparency. As of now, there are no studies that have proven the claim that GMOs cause health risks and issues yet mass marketing has denoted the presence of GMOs and their impact to the world. While this may not be directly influenced by consumers entirely, the reason does shift to policymakers and the agencies of the world whose voice in these matters play a major role in the climate of GMOs.
<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: lightblue; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">The Government: lack of Global Consensus</b></p>
The world’s biggest GM consumer is the United States whose FDA regulations allow for GMOs to stay in the market and provide cheaper alternatives to Americans. On the other end, the EU is the largest opposer to GM crops and their adoption. While the research and science is the same, the decisions and visions are vastly different and these decisions ultimately influence other countries from India to Turkey. Government regulation of GM foods is not straightforward and numerous parties have a stake in influencing the regulatory policies of GM food especially NGOs, farmers, and biotechnology companies. In the US for example, the FDA applies the same regulations for basic food products to GM products since the final products are considered to be similar. The FDA, USDA, and EPA all agree that based on scientific evidence, GM foods fall under the classification of generally recognized as safe. However, the FDA only provides an optional consultation process to determine whether that companies go through a voluntary consultation process to determine whether their new GM food would require premarket approval if it were to contain high levels of toxic substances or allergens, yet this is never the case so far in history. For example, Bt11 corn was engineered to express a protein from the species of bacteria that is toxic to the European corn borer and the company which submitted this consultation also submitted data that compared conventional corn and BT11 corn. The FDA found that the amount of protein, oil, starch, and fiber in the compared plants were not significantly different hence it did not require additional testing. From an environmental standpoint, the EPA regulations on how pesticides affect human and environmental health extend to GMN plants that produce insecticidal substances. The EPA found that risk of insect resistance in Bt11 corn to human health was not there, hence they set a set of guidelines to reduce the potential of Bt11 corn produced sufficiently high amounts of insecticide and plantain no-Bt11 plants alongside Bt11 crops.<br></br>
The EU on the other hand imposed strict regulations on GM foods through its general policy for GM food regulation in 2002. This was meant to reflect the public concern regarding the food safety crises of the 1990s which ultimately made consumers far more skeptical of GM products. Henceforth, they must all go through a centralized process where the EFSA evaluates the human and environmental risks of the product. This is then passed down to the committee of member states where a vote is taken place. Labelling is also far more transparent in GM products which contain more than 0.9% of GM material. The outcomes of such regulations are distinct as lenient procedures have increased GM food products in the US while the opposite is true for the EU which has approved fewer than forty GM foods. This makes the US the world’s largest Gm cultivator with over 70 million hectares of GM crops while Eu member states altogether grow on average less than 0.1 million hectares. Despite this, the scientific data that is presented is observed at the same caliber. Procedures are not homogenous and the world has not come to a consensus as of now. With the slow degradation of the EU, more power may return to individual countries and wider adoption of Gm crops can be seen for the better. The biggest problems policy makers face with GMOs is introducing new, invasive, and dangerous species into an unknown ecosystem. Similar to invasiveness, this can not only disrupt entire ecosystems but cause economic loss and interfere with the native wildlife in the area. There have been cases of this, specifically between the US and China where exports of GM corn from the US were found in China who had to close its borders to US imports, costing over 183 million in trade losses. For more information on the spread of gene flow across borders, read our ecosystem article. To combat problems in global trade and impacts to the environment, the WHO and FAO created a joint intergovernmental body called Codex which is responsible for developing standards, codes or practice, guidelines, and recommendations for international food safety in GM crops. However, Codex does not hold any legislative power over countries making it ineffective.
