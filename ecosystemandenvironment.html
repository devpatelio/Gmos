<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 60px; color: #32a89d; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">Non-Target Impacts <br></b></p>
<p class="text" style="position: relative; top: -40px;">
GMOs are very disruptive in both good and bad ways when it comes to being introduced into a new ecosystem. Many of them often have unintended consequences to other factors in the ecosystem that they are introduced in or the overall landscape of GMO usage and production. It is critical that we understand how GMOs are introduced into ecosystems and what that means for anything else that may be impacted by GM crops for the better or the worse. 
<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #32a89d; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">The Beneficiary of GM Crops</b></p>
GMOs were first designed and engineered to provide an advantage to modern day farming techniques and prevent its toll on the environment in an effort to preserve the Earth. One of the clear benefits that they bring is occupied space and maintenance for a yield. Studies found that certain GMOs facilitate no-till farming which does not disrupt soil through tillage, prevents soil erosion, and regulates soil moisture preventing overwatering or contamination through heavy metals. Many GM plants are also genetically designed to take in more carbon through their chlorophyll which improves not just the photosynthesis process which has a byproduct of oxygen gas but also supports carbon sequestration after cellular respiration which can reduce and store greenhouse gases in farms. Ultimately, this can make farms storage units for carbon waste, regulating agriculture’s high methane inducing agricultural practices and carbon footprint. Not only do GM crops require less resources but it also, while variably,  improves the farmer’s productivity through longer potential growing seasons or less labour for insecticides or watering. As previously stated, insect tolerance through the bacillus thuringiensis bacteria or Bt has significantly reduced global insecticide usage which has significantly decreased the effects of biomagnification to humans and neighbouring ecosystems. In the US, Bt crops reduced the use of insecticides by more than 124 million pounds from 1996 and 2011, decreasing the global impact of insecticides to the environment. 

<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #32a89d; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">The Other Side of the Coin</b></p>

Even with the many benefits of GM crops, the environment and other potential factors can be indirectly targeted and impacted negatively. One of the biggest claims bioengineers and gene flow specialists have been vocal about is the potential cross-breeding between different plants which can lead to hybridization and the unintended cross-pollination of crops. Ecologists also support this stating that the new presence of genotypes will quickly destroy any “native” species and natural selection will quickly remove any alleles that do not benefit the ecosystem. For certain species and consumers, this may benefit in the long term but in some cases, extensive cross pollination over distinct ecosystems can lead to invasive species growth. The problem with this is that unwanted genes can be mixed into a sustainable ecosystem potentially displacing the balance between primary and secondary consumers. Many species can go extinct or others can grow in population disrupting entire ecosystems and causing unexpected reactions. However, many biologists believe that the extent of certain GM crops cannot have a significant impact on ecosystems or other Non-GMO crops because in order for hybridization to occur, the species must have certain similarities making certain GM crops not as dangerous to existing native food sources. Despite this, there have been certain events in Canada where cross contamination between organic and GM crops have occured. A dangerous illustration of the impact of GM crops can be seen through the rapidly declining monarch butterfly populations. The spread of GM herbicide-tolerant corn and soy that are twinned with herbicides were introduced to the monarch’s habitat and competed for resources against their primary food source, milkweed. This led to the reduction of milkweed and hence the monarch butterfly population by more than 90% in under 20 years. The root cause of this can also be attributed to the growing herbicide industry which will be later discussed. The introduced GM crops were herbicide resistant and so farmers ended up using herbicides to kill unwanted weeds in the area but ultimately killed milkweed populations in the process. It is estimated that the monarch butterfly population lost more than 165 million hectares of land in 30 years.  The Canadian Biotechnology Action Network concluded from its extensive report that GM contamination is a pollution that “self-replicates” through a variety of vessels from cross-pollination to seed transfer. Pollen from Bt crops, for example, contain toxins which wash into streams near cornfields. Lab trials found that the consumption of Bt corn by products resulted in an increased mortality and reduced growth in caddisflies. Not only does this impact marine ecosystems but eliminates the primary consumer in the food chain. Non-target effects of contamination and gene flow can impact the future generations of many species and alter their genetic makeup in a matter of decades. This can cause imbalances in the food webs of certain ecosystems, limiting habitat availability and food sources for other important organisms. Gene flow is something that is unpredictable, and these non-target effects are very difficult to predict. New alleles can influence the spread of certain hybrid populations amongst a species creating competition between the two. This can lead to the creation of parasitic relationships and create unwanted competition that can disrupt the food chain through the introduction of new traits. Ultimately, transgenic organisms can be subjected to natural selection and hybridized colonies. 


<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #32a89d; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">The Herbicide Industry is the Root Cause: 
</b></p>

Before GM crops were introduced, farmers had a difficult time destroying weeds that would interfere in the growth and reproduction of the many crops at a farm. Once GM crops were twined with herbicide-tolerance, the growth of herbicide use globally shot up by 367% over the decade. Almost all of the GM crops grown internationally are engineered to be tolerant to a specific herbicide, most commonly glyphosate whose use tripled in Canada between 2005 and 2011. As previously mentioned, the impact of herbicides to ecosystems is dangerous. Leakage and pollution are abundant in farms that use herbicides and many water bodies and habitats are found to have organisms that have traces of glyphosate. More than 72 million birds are killed by herbicides each year through contaminated land, water, and air. With growing demand, the impacts of biomagnification of herbicides can increase dramatically.  The problem does not only originate here, but expands to weeds that are glyphosate resistant. After the growing use of herbicides, many weeds developed resistance against many herbicides making these “superweeds” far more invasive than ever. With the introduction and growth of industrial farming methods and the continuous usage of herbicides, the spread of superweeds continued internationally as many developing nations continued to use only glyphosate over the same large areas. As of now, there are 37 species of superweeds around the world, 5 of which are found in Canada. The USDA estimates that 28.3 million hectares of US farmland are infested with glyphosate-resistant weeds in 2013. The abuse of herbicides has not only had a damaging environmental impact but also a significant economic burden to farmers. In the US, weed management costs have increased by 50-100% more p[er hectare than without glyphosate resistant weeds. In many cases, GM crops have done more harm than well in these situations under the influence of chemical companies and the herbicide industry. Furthermore, the organisms and pests GM crops were designed to defend have made them stronger in some cases. Corn farmers in Canada found that the European corn borer, the insect pest Bt kills off through its toxins, had become resistant to its effects. This was the first reported instance of Bt-resistance bugs and soon after May 2019, these effects were also observed in the US, South Africa and Brazil. The rise of superbugs makes GM crops ineffective and have produced a strain of pests that are far more dangerous and invasive to ecosystems and the world food supply than ever. 

<p class="text"> <b style="font-size: 40px; color: #32a89d; font-family: CNN Stencil Display;">The Solution is Not Apparent 
</b></p>

While both sides of the coin of GMOs have an abundance of pros and cons, there is still a lot more we do not know or can predict. Yet even though there are several advantages, there are no grounded solutions to the many problems GM crops can cause. The first is that there are no designated set of regulations in place to preserve ecosystems and regulate GM farming practices. GM crops have a significant potential to improve and protect ecosystems from reducing potential effects of biomagnification, increasing the carrying capacity of unsustainable ecosystems, and protecting against invasive species, they can also cause much harm.  One solution to combat the problem of gene flow and uncontrollable growth is terminator seeds which sterilize a plant and can help isolate the spread of the species and preserve nearby biodiversity. New traits can also be engineered such as self-pollination which can prevent cross-pollination between certain plants or farmers can isolate growing GM crops altogether through buffer zones to separate Non-GM and GM crops. The idea of GM monocultures can be a great method to grow crops and supply them internationally. While these solutions may be promising, it will take international collaboration to mandate and regulate GM crops for the better of the world.
